# About this project

In this endeavor, I created a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game as an exercise to better understand bidimensional arrays. Through this project, I was able to explore the nuances of array manipulations and apply practical logic to bring the timeless game to life. It was both a challenging and rewarding experience, enhancing my grasp on data structures.
